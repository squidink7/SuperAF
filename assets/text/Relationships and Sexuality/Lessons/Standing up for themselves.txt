Impact of Assertive Behaviour and Standing Up for Themselves
Assertive behaviour means speaking up for yourself in a kind and confident way. It helps children and adults tell others what they need, want, or feel without being mean or rude. Standing up for themselves helps people feel respected and strong.
When someone is assertive, they can say no to things that are unsafe or make them uncomfortable. It also helps them ask for help when needed. Being assertive can prevent problems like bullying because others understand boundaries and know what is okay and not okay.
Assertive behaviour also helps people feel confident and proud. It teaches children to trust themselves and their choices. It can improve friendships because talking kindly and clearly helps people understand each other.
Using assertive behaviour helps the body, mind, and feelings feel safe and strong. Learning to stand up for themselves makes children more independent and able to solve problems. It also helps them understand that their thoughts, feelings, and needs are important.
