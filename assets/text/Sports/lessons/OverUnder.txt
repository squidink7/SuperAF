Over/Under is played in a line with a ball. The first person passes the ball over their head, then the next passes it under their legs, and so on down the line. When the ball reaches the last player, that player runs to the front and the game starts again. The race keeps going until the team crosses the finish line. If the ball is dropped, it must be picked up before play continues. Players need to stay in line and wait for their turn. Over/Under is about teamwork, speed, and helping each other finish.
