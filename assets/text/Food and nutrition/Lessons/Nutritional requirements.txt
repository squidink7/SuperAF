The body needs different kinds of food to stay healthy and strong. These needs are called nutritional requirements. Nutrients are the parts of food that help the body grow, have energy, and stay well. There are many kinds of nutrients, and each one does a special job.
Proteins help the muscles grow and repair when the body is tired or hurt. Carbohydrates give energy so the body can play, run, and learn. Fats also give energy and help the body use some vitamins. Vitamins and minerals help the body fight illness, keep the skin and bones strong, and make the body work properly. Water is very important too because it keeps the body hydrated and helps it work well.
Everyone needs to eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients the body needs. Eating from all the food groups every day helps the body stay strong, healthy, and full of energy. Learning about nutritional requirements helps people make good choices and take care of their bodies. Knowing which foods give which nutrients helps the body grow and work its best.
