The cardiovascular system is the transport network of the human body. It is responsible for moving blood, oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to every cell, while also removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. This system is essential for survival, as no part of the body could function without the constant supply of oxygen and nutrients carried by the blood. The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Each part works together in a continuous cycle that never stops during life.

The heart is the central organ of the cardiovascular system. It is a muscular pump about the size of a fist, located slightly to the left of the chest. The heart has four chambers. The top two are called atria, which receive blood coming into the heart, and the bottom two are called ventricles, which pump blood out. Valves separate the chambers and prevent blood from flowing backwards. The right side of the heart deals with deoxygenated blood, which means blood low in oxygen, and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart deals with oxygenated blood and pumps it around the rest of the body. The left ventricle has thicker walls than the right because it has to push blood a longer distance, through the entire body instead of just to the lungs.

Blood vessels are the pathways that carry blood to and from the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart. They have thick, elastic walls to withstand the high pressure of blood being pumped out. Veins carry blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls and valves that stop blood from flowing backwards, since blood pressure in veins is much lower. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. Their thin walls allow oxygen and nutrients to pass into tissues, while carbon dioxide and waste products pass out.

Blood itself is a liquid tissue with several important parts. Red blood cells carry oxygen using a protein called haemoglobin. White blood cells are part of the immune system and help defend the body against infection. Platelets are small fragments that help the blood to clot when there is a cut or injury. Plasma is the liquid portion that carries dissolved nutrients, hormones, and waste products.

The cardiovascular system performs many vital roles. Its main job is transporting oxygen from the lungs and nutrients from food to cells, so they can produce energy. It also removes waste products like carbon dioxide, which are carried to the lungs to be breathed out. The system helps control body temperature by directing more blood to the skin when the body is hot, allowing heat to escape, or keeping blood near the core when it is cold. Hormones produced by glands travel in the blood to target organs, ensuring the body can coordinate complex processes such as growth and reproduction.

Exercise places extra demand on the cardiovascular system. When the body is active, muscles need more oxygen and glucose to produce energy. The heart pumps faster and harder, increasing heart rate and stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped with each beat. Breathing also speeds up so that more oxygen can enter the blood in the lungs. Over time, regular exercise strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and makes the system more efficient. This is why athletes often have lower resting heart rates, as their hearts can pump more blood with each beat.

Problems can occur in the cardiovascular system, and these can have serious effects. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, puts strain on the heart and blood vessels. Atherosclerosis is when fatty deposits build up in arteries, making them narrower and less flexible. This can lead to heart attacks or strokes. Other conditions include anaemia, which happens when there are too few red blood cells, and heart failure, when the heart is not able to pump blood effectively. Lifestyle factors such as a poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and stress can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The cardiovascular system is vital for life, as it transports substances, removes waste, regulates temperature, and helps protect the body. Through the coordinated work of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, every cell in the body receives the materials it needs to function. Keeping this system healthy through exercise, good nutrition, and avoiding harmful habits supports long-term health and physical performance.
