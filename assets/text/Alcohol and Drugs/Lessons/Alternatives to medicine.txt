Sometimes the body can feel unwell, but it does not always need medicine to get better. There are many ways to help the body heal using rest, water, and healthy food. Sleeping or resting gives the body time to fight illness and feel strong again. Drinking water helps the body stay healthy and keeps it working properly. Eating fruit, vegetables, and other healthy foods can give energy and help the body recover.
Fresh air and exercise can also make people feel better. Going outside for a walk or playing can help the body feel strong and happy. Sometimes a warm bath, a hug, or talking to a trusted adult can help someone feel calm and better in their body and mind. These are all examples of ways to take care of the body without medicine. It is important to know that medicine should only be used when a trusted adult, like a parent or doctor, says it is needed. Using alternatives first can help people feel better safely and naturally. Learning about different ways to care for the body helps people make good choices for their health.
