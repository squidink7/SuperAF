Managing personal safety means knowing how to stay safe and protect yourself from harm. It helps children avoid accidents and make smart choices in different situations. Safety includes being aware of surroundings, following rules, and listening to trusted adults. Some ways to stay safe include looking both ways before crossing the street, wearing a helmet when riding a bike, and holding an adult’s hand in busy places. It is also important to keep away from dangerous objects or strangers and to tell an adult if something feels unsafe. Knowing your name, address, and how to call for help can also keep children safe. Personal safety also means understanding body boundaries. Children should know that their body belongs to them and it is okay to say no if someone tries to touch them in a way that makes them uncomfortable. Learning to speak up, stay alert, and follow safety rules helps prevent injuries and keeps children confident and secure. Managing personal safety helps children feel strong, protected, and ready to enjoy daily activities safely.
