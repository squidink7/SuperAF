Tag is a chasing game. One person is “it.” They try to tag another player by gently touching them. When someone is tagged, they become “it.” Players must stay in the play area and cannot hide or leave. No pushing or tackling is allowed. The game keeps going as players run, dodge, and try not to get tagged. Tag is about running fast, being clever, and taking turns.
