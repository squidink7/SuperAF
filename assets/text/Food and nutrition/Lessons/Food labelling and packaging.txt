Food comes in many different packages, and the labels on these packages give important information. Food labels show what is inside the food and can help people make healthy choices. They can tell how much sugar, fat, protein, and other nutrients are in the food. Labels can also show the number of calories, the ingredients, and if the food has things that some people might be allergic to.
Packaging also keeps food safe and fresh. It protects food from dirt, germs, and damage while it is being stored or transported. Some packaging is made to keep food cold or warm, and some packages have special seals to show if the food has been opened. Reading labels and noticing the packaging helps people choose foods that are healthy and safe to eat. Food labels can also have pictures or symbols that show if the food is good for the environment, like recyclable packaging. Understanding food labels and packaging helps people learn about what they eat and make smart choices for their bodies. Knowing how to read labels helps everyone stay healthy and safe when choosing foods.
