Medicines are special substances that can help people feel better when they are sick or hurt. They can be tablets, liquids, or creams, and each type has a special job. Medicines are strong, so they must always be used in the right way. That is why only trusted adults, such as parents, carers, or doctors, should give medicine to children. It is never safe to take medicine by yourself. Some people might think that taking more medicine will make them better faster, but that is not true. Taking too much medicine can make a person very unwell. Medicines need to be given in the correct amount and at the correct time. This is why following instructions is so important. Medicines also need to be kept in safe places, often in cupboards that children cannot reach. This helps to keep everyone protected. It is also very important never to share medicine, because what helps one person might hurt another. Understanding how to use medicines safely helps people stay healthy. When medicines are used in the right way, they can help the body heal. When they are not used safely, they can cause harm instead of help.
