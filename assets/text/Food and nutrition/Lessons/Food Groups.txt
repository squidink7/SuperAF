Food helps the body grow, stay strong, and have energy to play and learn. There are different types of food called food groups, and each group has a special job to keep the body healthy. One group is fruit and vegetables. They give vitamins and minerals that help the body fight illness and keep the skin, eyes, and bones healthy. Another group is grains, like bread, rice, and pasta. Grains give energy so the body can move, run, and play.
Proteins are another food group. Foods like meat, eggs, fish, beans, and nuts help the muscles grow and repair when the body gets tired or hurt. Dairy foods, like milk, cheese, and yogurt, make the bones and teeth strong. Fats and oils are also important but should be eaten in small amounts. They give energy and help the body use vitamins.
Eating from all the food groups each day helps the body stay healthy and strong. It is important to choose a variety of foods to get all the vitamins, minerals, and energy the body needs. Learning about food groups helps people make good choices for a healthy life.
