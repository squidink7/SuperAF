Drugs are substances that can change how the body feels, thinks, or works. Some drugs are medicines that doctors use to help people when they are sick or in pain. These can be helpful when they are taken in the correct way. Medicines can fight illness, lower pain, and help the body heal. When used properly, they keep people healthy and strong.
There are also drugs that are unsafe. These drugs can hurt the body and make people feel unwell. Unsafe drugs can cause problems with the brain, the heart, and other parts of the body. They can make it hard to think clearly, move properly, or feel calm. Even medicines that are usually helpful can cause harm if they are taken in the wrong way or without an adult’s care.
The body works best when it is cared for with healthy food, water, rest, and exercise. Learning about the effects of drugs helps people understand why safe medicines must be used carefully and why unsafe drugs should be avoided. Making smart choices protects the body and helps it stay well.
