Tennis is played with rackets and a ball on a court with a net. The ball must be hit over the net into the other player’s side. The ball can bounce once before it is hit back. If the ball bounces twice, goes into the net, or goes outside the lines, the other player gets the point. The game begins with a serve that must land in the other side’s service box. Players take turns serving. Tennis is about keeping the ball in play, running fast, and hitting with control.
