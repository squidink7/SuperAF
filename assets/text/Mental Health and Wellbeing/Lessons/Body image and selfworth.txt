Body image is how someone thinks and feels about their own body. Self-worth is how much someone believes they are important and valuable. Both are very important for feeling happy and confident. Everyone’s body is different, and all bodies are good in their own way. Learning to like and respect the body helps people feel proud and strong.
Good body image and self-worth come from taking care of the body with healthy food, exercise, and rest. It also comes from thinking kind thoughts about oneself and noticing the good things the body can do, like run, jump, or dance. Comparing the body to others or thinking the body must look a certain way can make people feel sad or worried.
Talking to trusted adults, friends, or teachers can help children feel good about themselves. Being kind to oneself and focusing on what the body can do helps people feel confident and happy. Learning about body image and self-worth helps children understand that everyone is valuable, strong, and special, no matter how their body looks.
