Sedentary behaviours mean spending a lot of time sitting or lying down and not moving the body. Activities like watching TV, playing on a tablet, or sitting for a long time are examples of sedentary behaviours. While it can be fun to rest or watch something, doing too much sitting can make the body unhealthy. When the body does not move enough, the muscles can become weak, and the bones may not grow as strong. The heart and lungs also do not get the exercise they need to work well. Spending too much time sitting can make it harder to have energy to play, learn, and do daily activities. It can also make the body more likely to feel tired or gain too much weight. It is important to balance sitting with moving the body. Short breaks to walk, stretch, or play can help the body stay strong and healthy. Learning about sedentary behaviours helps people understand that moving is important. Choosing to be active and not sit for too long keeps the body strong, full of energy, and ready for fun.
