Some people are very important in a child’s life because they help keep them safe, happy, and healthy. These people can be parents, carers, family members, teachers, and friends. They help children learn new things, give love and support, and teach how to stay safe and make good choices. Important people listen when children have feelings or problems. They help children understand their emotions and show them how to cope with worry, sadness, or anger. They also help children learn new skills, like reading, writing, or playing games. Friends and family can share fun times and make life enjoyable. Trusting and respecting important people helps children feel safe and confident. Important people also show how to be kind, caring, and helpful to others. Knowing who these people are helps children ask for help when needed and feel supported in daily life. Learning about important people helps children understand that everyone needs help sometimes, and it is good to have people who care and guide them.
