Handball is a game played with a small ball inside a square. The ball is hit with the hand to keep it moving. The aim is to keep the ball in play and not let it stop. The ball must bounce once in the square before it is hit back. If the ball bounces twice, the player is out. If the ball goes outside the lines, the player who hit it is out. The game starts with a serve. The ball must bounce in the server’s square first, then into another player’s square. Players take turns hitting the ball. When a player is out, they move to the end of the line and the other players move up. The goal is to reach the top square and stay there as long as possible. Handball is about following the rules, playing fair, and having fun with friends.
