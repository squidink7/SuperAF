Jump is a skipping rope game. A long rope is swung around and players must jump over it without being touched. If the rope touches a player's feet or body, they are out and must wait for another turn. The rope must turn all the way around before players jump again. The aim is to jump for as long as possible without getting caught. Rope turners must swing the rope evenly to give everyone a fair chance. Jump is about timing, rhythm, and moving your body quickly.
