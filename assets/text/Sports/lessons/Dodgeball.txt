Dodgeball is played with soft balls and two teams. The aim is to throw the ball and hit players on the other team. If a player is hit, they are out and must wait on the side. If a player catches a ball, the thrower is out and one teammate can come back in. Players can dodge, duck, or jump to stay safe. No throwing at faces is allowed. The game goes until all players on one team are out. Dodgeball is about moving quickly, aiming carefully, and having fun together.
