Teams take turns running the course. Each player does their part, then tags the next teammate. The aim is for the whole team to finish. The fastest team wins. If someone skips a part, they must go back and try again before tagging. Teammates can cheer and encourage each other but cannot help on the course. Obstacle Course Team is about teamwork, effort, and finishing together.
