The musculoskeletal system is the part of the human body that makes movement possible. It is made up of bones, muscles, joints, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Each part has a special role, but they all work together to support the body, allow movement, and protect vital organs. Without this system the body would not be able to stand upright, move from place to place, or even carry out simple actions like picking up a pen. 

The skeleton is the framework of the body. An adult has two hundred and six bones. These bones are divided into two main sections. The axial skeleton includes the skull, spine, and rib cage, and its main role is to provide support and protection. The appendicular skeleton includes the arms, legs, and the bones that attach them to the body, such as the pelvis and shoulders. Its main role is movement. Bones come in different shapes that match their jobs. Long bones, such as the femur, act as levers. Short bones, like those in the wrist, give strength and stability. Flat bones, such as the ribs and skull, protect organs. Irregular bones, like the vertebrae, have unique shapes for special functions. 

Movement would not be possible without joints, which are places where bones meet. Some joints, like those in the skull, do not move, while others, like those in the spine, allow only a small amount of movement. The most important for everyday life and sport are synovial joints. These joints are freely movable and filled with fluid that reduces friction, allowing smooth movement. Different types of synovial joints allow different actions. The ball and socket joint in the hip and shoulder allows movement in many directions, while the hinge joint in the knee and elbow allows bending and straightening. 

Connective tissues hold the skeleton together and make movement possible. Ligaments connect bone to bone and keep joints stable. Tendons connect muscles to bones, transferring the pulling force of a muscle contraction onto the skeleton. Cartilage covers the ends of bones and prevents them from rubbing together, while also absorbing shock. 

The muscular system works with the skeleton to produce movement. There are three types of muscle in the body. Skeletal muscles attach to bones and are under voluntary control, meaning movements can be chosen and controlled. Smooth muscles are found inside organs such as the stomach and work without conscious thought. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart and keeps blood circulating through the body. Skeletal muscles are the ones most involved in physical activity. They work by contracting and relaxing, and because they can only pull, they operate in pairs. For example, the biceps contract to bend the arm, while the triceps contract to straighten it again. 

The musculoskeletal system also provides other important functions. The skeleton protects delicate organs such as the brain, heart, and lungs. Bones store minerals such as calcium and phosphorus, which are important for strength and other body processes. Bone marrow produces red and white blood cells that are essential for life. Muscles generate heat during contraction, helping to maintain body temperature. 

Keeping the musculoskeletal system healthy is important for daily life and sport. Exercise strengthens muscles and bones, while a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D keeps bones strong. Warming up and cooling down during physical activity helps to prevent injuries. Protecting the body through safe techniques and equipment also reduces the risk of damage.
