Physical activities like playing games, running, dancing, or riding a bike help the body, but they also help the mind and feelings. When children play with friends, they learn how to share, take turns, and work together. These are social skills that help people make friends and enjoy being part of a group. Being active can also make people feel happy. Exercise helps the body release chemicals that make the mind feel good and calm. Moving the body can reduce feelings of sadness or worry and help people feel more confident. When children reach a goal, like learning a new game or skill, it gives them a sense of pride and achievement. Playing and being active also teaches children how to handle winning and losing. Learning to be patient, follow rules, and support others builds strong friendships and good behaviour. Being active is not just about the body; it helps people feel happy, confident, and connected to others. Learning about these benefits helps children make choices that are good for both their bodies and minds.
