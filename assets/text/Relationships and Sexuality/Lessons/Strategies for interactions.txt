Strategies for Interactions
Interactions are how people talk, listen, and play with each other. Good interactions help people understand each other and get along. Strategies for interactions are ways to make these times friendly, safe, and respectful.
One strategy is listening carefully when someone else is talking. This shows respect and helps understand their feelings and ideas. Another strategy is speaking clearly and kindly, using words that are polite and friendly. Taking turns is also important so everyone can share their thoughts and have fun.
Using eye contact and smiling helps show that someone is paying attention and cares about the conversation. Asking questions when unsure can help people understand better. Showing patience and being calm, even when things are hard, helps interactions stay positive.
Learning strategies for interactions helps children make friends, solve problems, and feel included. It also helps people feel safe, respected, and happy when talking or playing with others. Good strategies make it easier to work together, share ideas, and enjoy time with family, friends, and teachers.
