Coping Skills and Help-Seeking Strategies
Coping skills are ways to deal with feelings when someone is upset, worried, or angry. Everyone has feelings, and sometimes they can be big or confusing. Coping skills help the body and mind feel calmer and stronger. Some ways to cope include taking deep breaths, counting to ten, drawing, listening to music, or going outside to play. These activities can help the mind feel better and make it easier to think clearly.
Help-seeking strategies mean asking for support from someone who can help. Trusted adults like parents, carers, teachers, or school counsellors can listen, give advice, and help solve problems. Asking for help is a smart and strong choice. It is okay to talk about feelings and ask questions when something feels difficult.
Using coping skills and asking for help helps people manage their feelings safely. It also helps children learn to understand their emotions and solve problems in a positive way. Learning these skills and strategies keeps the mind healthy, helps people feel safe, and makes it easier to enjoy daily life.
