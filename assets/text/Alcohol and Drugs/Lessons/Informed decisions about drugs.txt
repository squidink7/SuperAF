Drugs are substances that can change the way our bodies feel or work. Some drugs are medicines that doctors or carers give to help people when they are sick or in pain. Other drugs are not safe and can harm the body or mind. It is important to understand the difference so that good choices can be made.
When people make informed decisions, it means they think carefully, ask questions, and listen to trusted adults before taking any substance. Children should always talk to a parent, carer, or doctor if they are unsure about a drug or medicine. This helps keep the body safe and healthy.
Some drugs, like those given by a doctor, can help fight illness and make people feel better when used the right way. But if they are taken in the wrong way, or if they are drugs that are not meant to be used, they can make someone very unwell.
Learning about drugs helps people understand that saying no to unsafe substances is a strong and smart choice. Making safe decisions means caring for the body, keeping it healthy, and asking for help whenever something feels confusing or unsafe.
