Soccer is played by kicking a ball on a field with two goals. The aim is to kick the ball into the other teamâ€™s goal to score a point. The ball can be kicked or stopped with the feet, but hands and arms are not allowed, except for the goalie who can stop the ball near the goal. The game begins with a kick in the middle. If the ball goes outside the lines, the other team gets to throw or kick it back in. Players must not push or trip each other. Soccer is about passing, sharing the ball, playing fair, and working together as a team.
