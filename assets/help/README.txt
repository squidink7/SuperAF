To add your own lessons, create a folder with the topic name you'd like, create another folder inside named lessons, then add a .txt file containing the lesson text.

Your files should look something like this:

topics/
- README.txt [this file]
- my topic/
  - lessons/
    - intro.txt
	- content.txt
	- revision.txt
	[etc...]
