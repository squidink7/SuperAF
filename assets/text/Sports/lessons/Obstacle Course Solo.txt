An obstacle course has things to climb over, crawl under, jump across, and run around. The aim is to finish the course as fast as possible while doing every part. Each player runs one at a time. If something is missed, the player must go back and try again. Everyone should cheer for others as they go. Obstacle Course Solo is about being strong, fast, and not giving up.
