Safety at school means making sure everyone can learn, play, and have fun without getting hurt. There are many rules and habits that help children stay safe while at school. Children should walk, not run, in classrooms and hallways to avoid accidents. Using playground equipment carefully and taking turns helps prevent injuries during playtime. It is important to listen to teachers, staff, and playground supervisors because they help keep everyone safe. Knowing how to cross the school yard or street safely is also important. Children should follow signs, walk on paths, and hold hands with friends if needed. Personal safety is important too. Children should know it is okay to say no if something makes them uncomfortable and ask a trusted adult for help if needed. Learning where the first aid kit is and who to call for help in an emergency helps children stay safe. Safety at school helps everyone feel confident, protected, and able to enjoy learning and playing. Following safety rules, listening to adults, and being aware of surroundings keeps the body and mind safe every day.
