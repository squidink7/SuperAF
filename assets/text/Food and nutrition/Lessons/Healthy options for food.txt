Food can help the body stay healthy or make it unwell, depending on the choices people make. Healthy food gives energy, helps the body grow, and keeps it strong. Foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and dairy are healthy options. These foods have vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that help the body fight illness, build muscles, and have strong bones. Sometimes foods can be less healthy, like sweets, chips, or sugary drinks. Eating these foods too often can give the body too much sugar, fat, or salt. This can make the body tired, cause problems with teeth, or make it harder for the body to stay strong. Choosing healthy options helps people feel good and have energy to play and learn. Drinking water instead of sugary drinks is a healthy choice. Eating a variety of foods from all food groups is also important. Learning about health options for food helps people make smart choices that keep the body safe, strong, and full of energy.
