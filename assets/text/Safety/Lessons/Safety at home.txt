Safety at home means making sure the house is a place where everyone can live without getting hurt. It helps children avoid accidents and stay healthy. There are many ways to be safe at home. Some safety rules include keeping sharp objects like knives out of reach, not touching hot surfaces like stoves or ovens, and using safety gates or locks when needed. Electrical cords and plugs should be used carefully, and water should be checked for the right temperature before bathing. Floors should be kept tidy to avoid trips and falls. It is also important to know who to call in an emergency, such as parents, carers, or emergency services like 000. Learning where the first aid kit is and how to use it can help if someone gets hurt. Personal safety is also important at home. Children should know it is okay to say no if something makes them uncomfortable and to ask for help if needed. Following safety rules at home helps children feel secure, confident, and able to enjoy playing and learning. Being careful and aware keeps the body safe and healthy every day.
