First aid is the help given to someone who is hurt or sick before a doctor or nurse can help. Emergency care is the help given when something serious happens, like a big cut, a burn, or if someone cannot breathe. Knowing first aid and emergency care helps keep people safe and can even save lives.
Some first aid actions include cleaning a small cut, putting on a bandage, or helping someone rest when they feel dizzy. It is important to stay calm and check if the person is hurt badly. If the injury is serious, calling an adult or emergency services, like 000, is very important. First aid also means not touching dangerous things and making sure the area is safe.
Learning first aid and emergency care teaches children how to help themselves and others safely. It helps children know what to do when someone is hurt and how to stay calm in tricky situations. Being careful, asking for help, and knowing simple first aid steps helps the body heal and keeps everyone safe.
