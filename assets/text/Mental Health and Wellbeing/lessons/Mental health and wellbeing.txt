Mental health is about how someone thinks, feels, and copes with life. Wellbeing means feeling happy, safe, and able to enjoy daily activities. Both are important for children and adults to live a healthy and full life. People can have good mental health when they feel calm, confident, and able to handle challenges. There are many ways to keep the mind healthy. Talking to trusted adults, friends, or teachers about feelings helps people feel supported. Doing activities like playing, reading, drawing, or exercising can help the mind feel calm and happy. Resting and sleeping enough is also important for mental health. Learning to understand feelings and express them in positive ways helps people feel strong and safe. Sometimes people may feel sad, worried, or angry. These feelings are normal, but if they last a long time or feel too big, asking for help is important. Mental health and wellbeing can improve when children use coping skills, share feelings, and take care of their bodies. Understanding mental health helps children grow happy, confident, and ready to enjoy life.
