Tunnels and Trains is played in pairs or groups. One player makes a tunnel by standing with legs apart. The other player, the train, crawls through the tunnel. Then they swap roles. In a line game, many tunnels stand in a row and one train crawls through them all before joining the end. If the train bumps into someone, they must try again carefully. Players need to wait their turn and take care not to knock others. Tunnels and Trains is about sharing, moving carefully, and helping friends.
