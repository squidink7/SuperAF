Holistic health means looking after the whole person, including the body, mind, and feelings. Wellbeing is how happy, healthy, and safe someone feels. Taking care of the whole person helps children and adults feel their best in every part of life. Physical health is part of holistic health. Eating healthy food, drinking water, sleeping well, and being active keeps the body strong and full of energy. Mental health is also important. Understanding feelings, coping with worries, and asking for help when needed keeps the mind calm and happy. Emotional health is another part. Feeling confident, safe, and able to talk about feelings helps people enjoy life and make friends. When all parts of health are cared for together, wellbeing improves. Children who eat well, move their bodies, rest enough, and express feelings positively feel happier, stronger, and more confident. Holistic health teaches that every part of a person matters. Learning about holistic health helps people make choices that keep the body, mind, and feelings safe and healthy. Good choices help children grow, play, learn, and enjoy life.
